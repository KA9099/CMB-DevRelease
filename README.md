# Circuit Map Builder - DevRelease
This is a dev build that I am releasing. It is not an open beta so I will not be implementing the feedback, but I will appreciete any feedback I get.
It is closed source as of now, I will make it open source as promised once I refactor the code first.
# Warning
It does **NOT HAVE A SAVE** feature or a way of exporting the track. If you want to share the track you'd have to screenshot. 
# Controls
- Hold shift to delete nodes and track numbers
- Right click to go to view mode
- Add new nodes in between two nodes by clicking on the track that lies inbetween the two nodes.
